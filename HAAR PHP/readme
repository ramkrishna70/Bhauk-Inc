HAARPHP Feature Detection Library for PHP

based on Viola-Jones Feature Detection Algorithm using Haar Cascades

This is a port of OpenCV C++ Haar Detection (actually a port of JViolaJones which is a port of OpenCV for Java)
to PHP.

You can use the openCV cascades to build your detectors.

To do this just transform the opencv xml file to PHP
using the haartophp tool (in cascades folder)

example:
( to use opencv's haarcascades_frontalface_alt.xml  run following command)
haartophp haarcascades_frontalface_alt 

this creates a php file:
haarcascades_frontalface_alt.php which you can include in your php application

the variable to use in php
is similarly
$haarcascades_frontalface_alt

Examples  included with face detection
